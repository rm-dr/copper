**Copper** is the universal, automatic digital library.

</div>

---

Copper is the universal digital library, aiming to replace ad-hoc solutions like [Paperless], [Calibre], and [Beets].
It provides powerful data processing pipelines and universal item search, editing, and viewing

## ðŸš¨ Warning ðŸš¨

- [Webui v1](https://github.com/rm-dr/copper/milestone/2)
- [Data integrity](https://github.com/rm-dr/copper/milestone/4)

PRs are very welcome, especially for the web ui!

## Non-features

Functionality that is intentionally omitted from Copper. Use a better tool.

- Low-code workflows
  - Copper processes data, not logic.
  - **Instead, use** [Node-red](https://github.com/node-red/node-red) or [n8n](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n).
- Advanced playback UI
  - Copper's ui is designed to _manage_ media, not _consume_ it.
  - **Instead, use** [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/).

## Getting started

Copper is designed to be run in docker. To get started, to the following:

- Download the contents of [`./dist`](./dist/)
- `cd dist`
- `docker compose up -d`
- Read `./dist/docker-compose.yml` \
  If you want to run the stack manually, see [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

A prebuild docker image will be published once Copper reaches v1.

## User Documentation

Has yet to be written. It will likely be embedded in Copper's web ui.
